//USAGE
//"url" and "box" are mandatory keys, remaining keys are optional.
//"url" value can either be a list of URLs if heavy scraping is to be carried out or a "combined url" as in the given example, if such format is used the scraper will scrape url from "...?page=1" to "...?page=2".
//When heavy scraping "box" can be left with no value.
//For every other selector declared, the selector key will be used as header in the output csv file.
